# hello-world
Introductory repository of my background.
Padmini Jayanti speaking to all of you! I am aspiring to become data scientist, currently in the final semester of my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Wayne State University, Detroit, USA.
I am looking out for full-time jobs in Germany and USA as well, specifically in Data Science. My dream destination is Germany and so I'm on the process of finding myself a job in Germany by all means.
I have C++, JAVA and basic Python coding skills. A good amount of knowledge in subjects like AI, Game programming and Machine Learning.
